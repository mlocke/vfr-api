  - Both marked as âœ… PRODUCTION

**Lines Changed:** Complete rewrite of Machine Learning section (15+ lines)

---

### 4. code-rules.md âœ…
**Status:** No changes needed

**Reason:** File contains coding standards and rules only, no ML ensemble-specific references

---

### 5. SMART_MONEY_FLOW_ENSEMBLE_INTEGRATION.md âœ…
**Status:** Already accurate (no changes needed)

**Note:** This file was created during the integration and correctly documents the 3â†’4 transition

## Key Points Now Documented

1. **Ensemble Size**: 3 models â†’ 4 models (Oct 13, 2025)
2. **Smart Money Flow Status**: Standalone â†’ Ensemble + Standalone
3. **Ensemble Weights**: Rebalanced to 45% / 27% / 18% / 10%
4. **Database**: ModelRegistry returns 4 deployed models
5. **Feature Toggle**: Smart Money Flow defaultState changed from false â†’ true
6. **API Responses**: mlPredictionsCount now returns 4
7. **Logs**: Ensemble logs show "Found 4 deployed models"
8. **Voting Algorithm**: Updated to include 4th model vote
9. **Integration Scripts**: register-smart-money-flow-model.ts, deploy-smart-money-flow-model.ts
10. **Dual Mode**: Smart Money Flow runs both in ensemble AND standalone

---

## Verification Commands

### Check Database
```sql
SELECT model_name, model_version, status
FROM ml_models
WHERE status='deployed';
-- Should return 4 rows
```

### Test Ensemble
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/analyze \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mode": "single", "symbol": "AAPL", "include_ml": true}'
# Response should show 4 votes in mlPrediction.votes
```

### Check Logs
```bash
grep "Found.*deployed models" logs/app.log
# Should show "Found 4 deployed models"
```

## Regression Prevention

### Critical Points to Monitor
1. **Ensemble Size**: Always verify 4 models are returned by getDeployedModels()
2. **Weight Sum**: Ensure weights sum to 100% (0.45 + 0.27 + 0.18 + 0.10 = 1.0)
3. **Feature Toggle**: Smart Money Flow should be enabled by default
4. **Database Status**: smart-money-flow v3.0.0 must have status='deployed'
5. **API Responses**: mlPredictionsCount must be 4 (not 3)

### Documentation Maintenance
- When adding new models, update all 3 core docs:
  - ML_ENSEMBLE_ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md
  - ML_ENSEMBLE_SUMMARY.md
  - README.md
- When rebalancing weights, update all voting examples
- When deprecating models, update database AND documentation

---

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track 4-model ensemble vs 3-model baseline
2. **Weight Optimization**: Consider dynamic weight adjustment based on model performance
3. **Documentation**: Update API documentation to mention 4-model ensemble
4. **Testing**: Add integration tests to verify 4 models are always used
5. **Alerts**: Set up monitoring to alert if ensemble falls back to <4 models
