# Smart Money Flow Ensemble Integration - Oct 13, 2025

## Summary

Smart Money Flow model v3.0.0 has been successfully integrated into the ML ensemble, bringing the total from **3 models to 4 models**.

## What Was Done

### 1. Model Registration âœ…
- Created registration script: `scripts/ml/register-smart-money-flow-model.ts`
- Registered smart-money-flow v3.0.0 in PostgreSQL ModelRegistry
- Status: `deployed`
- Model ID: `64399324-8889-4d9d-ade6-1d09d94da50e`

### 2. Model Deployment âœ…
- Created deployment script: `scripts/ml/deploy-smart-money-flow-model.ts`
- Deployed smart-money-flow v3.0.0 to production ensemble
- Verified 4 models are now deployed in the database

### 3. Feature Toggle Update âœ…
- Updated `MLFeatureToggleService.ts`
- Changed `SMART_MONEY_FLOW.defaultState` from `false` â†’ `true`
- Updated description to reflect production model v3.0.0 (27 features)
- Cleared Redis cache to force reinitialization with new default

### 4. Ensemble Configuration âœ…
- Verified `RealTimePredictionEngine.predictEnsemble()` includes smart-money-flow
- Updated ensemble weight documentation (27 features, not 18)
- Confirmed feature extractor mapping includes smart-money-flow

## Current Ensemble Configuration

### Deployed Models (4 total)
```
early-signal        v1.0.0    deployed    18% weight
price-prediction    v1.1.0    deployed    27% weight
sentiment-fusion    v1.1.0    deployed    45% weight
smart-money-flow    v3.0.0    deployed    10% weight âœ¨ NEW
                                         ----
                                         100% total
```

### Ensemble Weights
- **sentiment-fusion**: 45% (most comprehensive - 45 features)
- **price-prediction**: 27% (baseline technicals - 35 features)
- **early-signal-detection**: 18% (analyst upgrades - 28 features)
- **smart-money-flow**: 10% (institutional activity - 27 features) âœ¨ **NEW**

### Smart Money Flow Features (27 total)
- **Congressional Trading** (4 features): buy/sell counts, sentiment, recent activity
- **Institutional Activity** (3 features): volume ratio, concentration, dark pool
- **Price/Volume Technicals** (3 features): momentum, trend, volatility
- **Options Activity** (17 features): put/call ratios, premiums, OI, Greeks, IV

## How It Works

### Ensemble Prediction Flow
1. User makes request with `include_ml=true`
2. `MLEnhancedStockSelectionService.selectStocks()` calls `predictEnsemble()`
3. `RealTimePredictionEngine.predictEnsemble()` queries ModelRegistry
4. ModelRegistry returns **4 deployed models** (was 3, now 4)
5. Each model runs prediction in parallel:
   - `sentiment-fusion` â†’ BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL
   - `price-prediction` â†’ BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL
   - `early-signal-detection` â†’ BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL
   - `smart-money-flow` â†’ BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL âœ¨ **NEW**
6. Votes are weighted and combined:
   - Weighted voting: `effectiveWeight = baseWeight * modelConfidence`
   - Normalization: scores divided by total weight
   - Consensus: highest score wins
7. Returns consensus signal with confidence and breakdown

### Example Ensemble Calculation
```
Symbol: AAPL

Model Votes:
- sentiment-fusion:     BULLISH @ 0.78 confidence â†’ 0.45 * 0.78 = 0.351
- price-prediction:     BULLISH @ 0.65 confidence â†’ 0.27 * 0.65 = 0.176
- early-signal:         NEUTRAL @ 0.52 confidence â†’ 0.18 * 0.52 = 0.094
- smart-money-flow:     BULLISH @ 0.70 confidence â†’ 0.10 * 0.70 = 0.070 âœ¨ NEW

Scores:
- Bullish: (0.351 + 0.176 + 0.070) / 1.0 = 0.597 (59.7%)
- Neutral: 0.094 / 1.0 = 0.094 (9.4%)
- Bearish: 0.0 / 1.0 = 0.0 (0%)

Consensus: BULLISH with 59.7% confidence
Composite Score: 50 + (0.597 * 50) = 79.85 (0-100 scale)
```

## Feature Toggle Status

**Smart Money Flow is now ENABLED by default** âœ…

- Previously: `defaultState: false` (beta model, needed retraining)
- Now: `defaultState: true` (production model v3.0.0, 27 features)
- Toggle will show as ENABLED in admin dashboard on next page load

## Verification

### Check Database
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT model_name, model_version, status FROM ml_models WHERE status='deployed';"
```

Expected output:
```
early-signal      | 1.0.0 | deployed
price-prediction  | 1.1.0 | deployed
sentiment-fusion  | 1.1.0 | deployed
smart-money-flow  | 3.0.0 | deployed  âœ…
```

### Test Ensemble
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/analyze \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "mode": "single",
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "include_ml": true
  }'
```

Look for in response:
- `ml_predictions.consensus.votes` should contain 4 model votes
- One vote should be from `smart-money-flow` with 10% effective weight

### Check Admin Dashboard
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "ML Feature Toggles"
3. Verify "Smart Money Flow" shows as ENABLED (green toggle)

## Troubleshooting

### If ensemble still shows 3 models instead of 4:
1. Verify smart-money-flow is deployed:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/ml/deploy-smart-money-flow-model.ts
   ```

2. Check database:
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT * FROM ml_models WHERE model_name='smart-money-flow';"
   ```

3. Restart application to clear in-memory caches

### If toggle shows as disabled:
1. Clear Redis cache:
   ```bash
   redis-cli DEL "ml_feature_toggle:smart_money_flow"
   ```

2. Reload admin dashboard page

3. Or manually enable via API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/ml-toggles/smart-money-flow/enable
   ```

## Files Modified

1. **Created**:
   - `scripts/ml/register-smart-money-flow-model.ts`
   - `scripts/ml/deploy-smart-money-flow-model.ts`

2. **Updated**:
   - `app/services/admin/MLFeatureToggleService.ts` (defaultState: false â†’ true)
   - `app/services/ml/prediction/RealTimePredictionEngine.ts` (feature count comment)

3. **Database**:
   - PostgreSQL `ml_models` table (new row for smart-money-flow v3.0.0)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track ensemble predictions with 4 models vs. 3 models
2. **Adjust Weights**: If smart-money-flow proves more/less reliable, adjust from 10%
3. **Retrain Models**: As new data comes in, consider retraining all models
4. **A/B Testing**: Use ModelRegistry A/B testing to compare 3-model vs 4-model ensemble

## Notes

- Smart Money Flow runs **both** in the ensemble AND standalone (via `includeSmartMoneyFlow` flag)
- Ensemble integration: activated when `include_ml=true`
- Standalone integration: activated when `includeSmartMoneyFlow=true`
- Both can run simultaneously if both flags are set

---

**Integration Complete**: Smart Money Flow is now part of the ML ensemble! ðŸŽ‰
