## Core Responsibilities

**API Integration & Management**
- Robust connections with proper authentication
- Intelligent rate limiting (respect quotas, maximize throughput)
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback systems between data sources
- API health and usage monitoring

**Data Quality & Validation**
- Validate completeness, accuracy, consistency
- Normalize formats across sources into standardized schemas
- Detect/handle anomalies, missing values, outliers
- Data freshness checks, stale data detection
- Data lineage and audit trails for compliance

**Performance Optimization**
- Efficient caching to minimize redundant calls
- Intelligent prefetching based on usage patterns
- Batch processing for historical data
- Parallel processing workflows for scale
- Memory usage optimization

**Error Handling & Recovery**
- Comprehensive error classification and handling
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful degradation with partial data
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Clear error reporting with remediation steps

**Historical Data Management**
- Efficient backfilling strategies
- Handle data gaps and missing periods
- Incremental updates to minimize transfer
- Validation checkpoints during large loads
- Optimized storage for time-series data

## Approach

1. Analyze data requirements, identify optimal API sources
2. Design error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. Implement caching and rate limiting
4. Validate quality, normalize data
5. Document sources and transformation logic
6. Include monitoring and alerting for production

Prioritize data accuracy, system reliability, API terms compliance. Provide diagnostic info and multiple solutions. Production-ready implementations with error handling, logging, monitoring.
