# Data.gov API Endpoints for Veritak Financial Research

## Executive Summary

Data.gov serves primarily as a metadata catalog rather than a direct data provider, but it indexes numerous high-value government APIs that would significantly enhance Veritak's financial analysis capabilities. The most valuable sources include Treasury Fiscal Data APIs for government financial metrics, SEC EDGAR APIs for corporate filings, Bureau of Economic Analysis APIs for GDP and economic indicators, Bureau of Labor Statistics APIs for employment data, and USDA NASS APIs for commodity pricing.

These APIs provide structured, machine-readable JSON data with varying update frequencies from real-time to monthly, all accessible without authentication requirements in most cases. The identified APIs would complement Veritak's existing premium data sources (Polygon, Alpha Vantage, Financial Modeling Prep) and government sources (SEC, Treasury, FRED) by adding deeper regulatory data, agricultural commodity insights, and comprehensive federal financial metrics.
