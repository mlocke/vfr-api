# SentimentAnalysisService Performance Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive performance testing strategy has been implemented for the SentimentAnalysisService to validate the <500ms response time target and memory efficiency requirements. The solution uses real NewsAPI integration (NO MOCK DATA) and provides extensive monitoring and reporting capabilities.

## 🚀 Implementation Details

### Core Performance Test Suite
**File**: `app/services/financial-data/__tests__/SentimentAnalysisService.performance.test.ts`

- **Parallel Processing Efficiency**: Validates concurrent request handling and resource optimization
- **Cache Performance**: Ensures >80% hit rate after warm-up phase
- **Real API Integration**: Tests with actual NewsAPI calls using production symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, TSLA)
- **Garbage Collection Optimization**: Monitors memory cleanup and GC efficiency

### Performance Testing Utilities
**File**: `app/services/financial-data/__tests__/utils/performance-utils.ts`
