Current market sentiment on Wells Fargo (WFC) is a Moderate Buy, according to a composite of recent analyst ratings. The bank is supported by a stable-to-positive outlook for the U.S. economy, strong liquidity, and capital management following the recent lifting of regulatory asset caps.
However, some analysts have recently adjusted their ratings or expressed caution due to short-term challenges.
Analyst ratings and price targets
As of late September 2025, Wall Street analysts generally hold a positive view on WFC, though with some variation:
Consensus Rating: Moderate Buy.
Recent Ratings Changes:
Evercore ISI Group raised its price target to $98 and maintained an "Outperform" rating on September 30, 2025.
Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from "Overweight" to "Equal-Weight" on September 29, 2025, but raised its price target to $95.
Average Price Target: Across analyst forecasts, the average 12-month price target is approximately $87 to $88, indicating limited near-term upside from its current price of around $83â€“$85.
Bullish arguments (Buy)
Lifting of Asset Cap: The removal of the long-standing regulatory asset cap is a major positive catalyst. It allows Wells Fargo to pursue growth more aggressively and could lead to expanded profitability.
Cost Efficiency: The company has been executing on cost-cutting measures, such as reducing its branch network and headcount. This is expected to enhance profitability in 2025.
Solid Liquidity and Dividends: Wells Fargo boasts a strong liquidity position, which supports its capital distribution strategy. Following a successful stress test, the bank increased its quarterly common stock dividend in the third quarter of 2025.
Favorable Economic Backdrop: The anticipated shift toward lower interest rates is expected to stabilize funding costs and increase lending activity, which could boost Wells Fargo's net interest income.
Bearish arguments (Sell/Hold)
Net Interest Income (NII) Pressure: Despite the positive rate outlook, Wells Fargo's NII and net interest margin (NIM) have recently faced pressure and lagged behind some peers like Bank of America and Citigroup in the first half of 2025.
Near-Term Guidance: In mid-2025, some investors were disappointed with the bank's guidance on net interest income, which tempered expectations for its short-term performance.
Analyst Caution: The recent downgrade by Morgan Stanley to a "Hold" equivalent rating suggests that even as the company's prospects improve, some analysts believe the stock's valuation and limited near-term upside potential make it a less compelling "Buy" at current levels.
Valuation: While the company's valuation looks attractive relative to the industry average based on forward P/E, some technical indicators and analysts suggest the recent rally could be nearing a peak, inviting short-term pullbacks
