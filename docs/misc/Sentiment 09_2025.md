As of late September 2025, the market sentiment for Ford (F) stock is cautiously neutral to bearish, with many analysts issuing "Hold" or "Reduce" ratings. The average 12-month price target from analysts suggests a potential downside from its current trading price. While Ford is viewed as a value stock with a strong commercial vehicle segment, its electric vehicle (EV) business faces challenges.
Bearish factors and risks (Sell/Hold)
Analyst consensus: Several financial outlets report an analyst consensus rating of "Hold" or "Reduce" for Ford. Ratings are based on recent analyses from firms including Goldman Sachs, Barclays, and Wells Fargo, with many predicting a modest downside.
Declining guidance: Ford's management has lowered its adjusted EBIT forecast for 2025 due to various pressures, leading to investor concerns.
Unprofitable EV business: The company's electric vehicle segment, Model e, remains significantly unprofitable, booking substantial losses in 2025 despite revenue growth. The path to profitability for this division is still uncertain.
Competitive pressures: The automotive industry is highly competitive, and Ford faces margin pressure from both traditional automakers like General Motors and EV pure-plays like Tesla.
Dividend uncertainty: While Ford has paid a quarterly dividend, some analysts are concerned about its sustainability given the cash required to fund its EV transition and potential tariff-related costs.
Tariff impact: Increased tariff costs, particularly related to vehicles produced in Mexico, are expected to negatively impact Ford's financial results.
Quality and recall issues: Recent vehicle recalls have put pressure on warranty costs and margins.
Bullish factors and strengths (Buy/Hold)
Value proposition: Some analysts, like Morningstar, believe Ford is currently undervalued, with a fair value estimate significantly higher than its market price. Zack's Investment Research has also identified Ford as potentially undervalued for value investors.
Profitable legacy business: The commercial vehicle segment (Ford Pro) and the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) business (Ford Blue) remain strong profit drivers for the company. The Ford F-Series trucks, for instance, have high margins.
Strong cash flow and liquidity: Despite challenges, Ford has demonstrated resilient free cash flow and a healthy cash balance, which helps finance the EV transition and sustain dividends.
Hybrid vehicle success: Ford is seeing record sales in its hybrid lineup, which provides a more profitable and popular alternative to its fully electric vehicles.
EV strategy adjustments: Management is shifting its EV strategy to focus on a new, more affordable next-generation platform, signaling a more pragmatic approach to the challenging EV market.
Technical support: Technical analysis indicates Ford's stock has established support levels that could suggest limited downside risk, particularly for traders.
Summary
For long-term investors, Ford represents a complex, transitional investment. Its profitable legacy segments provide a steady cash flow and dividends, but the company's future hinges on its ability to make its EV business profitable. For those with a shorter time horizon, the market sentiment is more cautious, with recent analyst ratings and price targets suggesting a "Hold" or "Reduce."
