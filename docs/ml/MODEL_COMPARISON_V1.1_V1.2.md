## Per-Class Performance (v1.2.0)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| DOWN | 0.59 | 0.57 | 0.58 | 57.4% | 47 |
| NEUTRAL | 0.45 | 0.39 | 0.42 | 39.1% | 46 |
| UP | 0.67 | 0.75 | 0.71 | 75.4% | 57 |

**Observations:**
- **UP predictions**: Best performance (75.4% accuracy)
- **DOWN predictions**: Good performance (57.4% accuracy)
- **NEUTRAL predictions**: Weakest (39.1% accuracy) - common challenge in 3-class classification

## Confusion Matrix (v1.2.0)

```
           Predicted
           DOWN  NEUTRAL  UP
Actual
DOWN       27    13       7
NEUTRAL    14    18       14
UP         5     9        43
```

**Analysis:**
- Model correctly identifies **75% of UP movements** (43/57)
- Model correctly identifies **57% of DOWN movements** (27/47)
- NEUTRAL class frequently misclassified as UP or DOWN (expected behavior)

## Next Steps

### âœ… Completed
1. Generated 1,000-row sentiment test dataset
2. Trained v1.2.0 model on 700 training examples
3. Validated +12.7% accuracy improvement

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
4. Generate full 73,200-row sentiment dataset (~10 hours)
5. Split full dataset into train/val/test (70%/15%/15%)
6. Retrain v1.2.0 on full 51,240-row training set
7. Evaluate on full 10,980-row test set

### ðŸ“Š Expected Production Results

## Recommendations

### âœ… Proceed with Full Dataset Generation
The +12.7% improvement on the test dataset justifies the ~10-hour investment to generate the full sentiment-enhanced dataset.

### ðŸŽ¯ Production Deployment
Once v1.2.0 is trained on the full dataset and accuracy is validated:
1. Update model registry to point to v1.2.0
2. Update prediction service to use 48-feature input
3. Monitor real-world performance for 1-2 weeks
4. Keep v1.1.0 as rollback option

### ðŸ”¬ Future Research
1. **Investigate sentiment_30d**: Low importance (75) suggests 30-day sentiment may be too stale
2. **NEUTRAL class improvement**: Consider binary classification (UP/DOWN only) or different threshold
3. **Feature engineering**: Try sentiment volatility, sentiment vs. price divergence
4. **Ensemble approach**: Combine v1.1.0 (technical) + v1.2.0 (sentiment) predictions

## Conclusion

The addition of FinBERT-based news sentiment features to the price prediction model resulted in a **significant +12.7% accuracy improvement** on the validation dataset. The `news_sentiment_momentum` feature proved particularly valuable, ranking 4th overall in feature importance.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with full dataset generation and production deployment of v1.2.0.
