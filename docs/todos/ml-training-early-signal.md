- Class imbalance
- Poor hyperparameters

**Solutions:**

- Generate more training data
- Review feature engineering

**Possible causes:**

- Too many features
- Too few training examples
- Features leaking future information

**Solutions:**

- Feature selection/reduction
- Add more training data
- Add regularization (L1/L2)
- Review feature extraction logic

---

### Issue: Model Files Not Created

**Possible causes:**

- Directory permissions
- Disk space
- Path errors

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Create directory manually
mkdir -p models/early-signal/v1.0.0

# Check permissions
ls -ld models/early-signal/

# Check disk space
df -h
```

    - Create performance baseline
    - Document any issues encountered

2. **Baseline Comparison**
    - Compare with random baseline (50% accuracy)
    - Compare with simple heuristics
    - Document improvement

3. **Production Monitoring**
    - Set up model performance tracking
    - Monitor prediction distribution
    - Track accuracy over time
    - Set up alerts for degradation

4. **Iteration Planning**
