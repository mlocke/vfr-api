docs/analysis-engine/roadmap/analysis-enging-improvements.mddocs/analysis-engine/roadmap/analysis-enging-improvements.md# **Short synopsis & high-impact recommendations**

**1\) Define the objective precisely.**  
 Decide exact prediction target(s): 1-day direction, 5-day return, probability of \>X% move, IV change, etc. Different targets need different labels, loss functions, and evaluation metrics (directional accuracy vs. information ratio vs. AUC vs. Sharpe).

**2\) Data quality, alignment, and provenance (first-order effect).**

- Build a _feature store_ with strict schemas, timestamp alignment, and event-time semantics (avoid look-ahead).

- Version all raw inputs and engineered features (DVC or similar).

- Validate feeds automatically (Great Expectations): missingness, duplicates, latency, stale prices. Garbage in → garbage out.

**3\) Labeling & leakage control.**

- Use _event-based labeling_ and robust forward-filling rules.

- Test for leakage by simulating production time (what would I have known at T?).

- Use transaction-cost-aware labels (net of expected costs) if the model drives trades.

**4\) Feature engineering & representation.**

- Combine fundamental, technical, options (IV surface, skew), sentiment (embedding vectors/topic exposures), and alternative data.

- Build multi-scale features (minute, hourly, daily) and relative features (z-scores, rank transforms) to handle cross-sectional and temporal heterogeneity.

- Use embeddings for tickers / sectors / filings to capture similarities.

**5\) Model design — ensembles \+ meta-learner.**

- Favor robust tree ensembles (LightGBM/CatBoost/XGBoost) and gradient-boosted models for tabular; use time-aware neural nets (temporal transformer, TCN, LSTM) where long sequences matter.

- Combine many _weakly-correlated_ models in an ensemble; then use a meta-learner (stacking) to produce final weights. This beats any single signal-weighting heuristic.

- Consider Bayesian model averaging or calibrated probabilistic outputs to capture uncertainty.

**6\) Time-series validation & backtesting rigour.**

- Use rolling/walk-forward CV, nested hyperparameter tuning, and out-of-sample windows partitioned by economic regimes.

- Backtests must include slippage, market impact, fees, latency, and realistic order filling.

- Report statistical confidence (bootstrap/resampling) for performance metrics and test for multiple hypothesis bias.

**7\) Online learning & non-stationarity handling.**

- Implement model retraining cadence driven by data drift detection (input drift, concept drift). Use incremental / online updates for short-horizon signals and periodic full retrain for structural shifts.

- Use regime detection (hidden Markov, clustering on volatility/returns) to switch models or adjust weights.

**8\) Risk, constraints & execution realism.**

- Optimize for risk-adjusted objective (maximize expected return subject to VaR/Drawdown constraints).

- Include portfolio-level constraints (position limits, turnover caps).

- Integrate execution simulator before real trades.

**9\) Monitoring, observability & governance.**

- Track prediction drift, feature distributions, production vs training performance, and model explainability (SHAP).

- Maintain model registry, CI/CD for models, canary deployment, and rollback procedures.

**10\) Explainability & calibration.**

- Use SHAP/feature-importance and calibration (isotonic/Platt) so probabilities match realized frequencies—crucial for sizing/positioning.

# **Prioritized checklist (first 6 weeks)**

1. Lock target labels \+ metrics.

2. Implement feature store \+ automated data validation.

3. Baseline model (LightGBM) with walk-forward backtest including fees.

4. Add meta-learner to combine signals.

5. Add drift detection & automated retrain pipeline.

6. Add monitoring dashboards (pred vs realized, SHAP).
