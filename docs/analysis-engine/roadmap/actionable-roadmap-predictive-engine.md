---

## **Phase 1 – Foundation & Target Definition (Week 1–2)**

Goal: Establish objectives, data standards, and ground rules.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **Define prediction target(s):** e.g., 1-day direction (classification), 5-day return (regression).

* **Choose evaluation metrics:** accuracy, AUC, Sharpe ratio, Information Ratio.

* **Write data schema & governance doc:** sources, timestamps, units, update frequency.

* **Implement data versioning:** DVC or Git-LFS for datasets.

* **Set up feature store skeleton:** define “ticker × timestamp” key, null handling, and storage backend (Postgres, DuckDB, or parquet on S3).

✅ **Output:** Clear spec for target labels, evaluation metrics, and a testable feature store scaffold.

---

## **Phase 2 – Data Collection & Validation (Week 2–4)**

Goal: Automate ingestion of high-quality, aligned data.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **Implement Python data collectors** for:

  * Prices & market depth (commercial API)

  * Options chain (IV, skew)

  * Fundamentals & filings (SEC, company reports)

  * Sentiment feeds (social/news APIs)

* **Automated validation pipeline:** Great Expectations checks (no future timestamps, no duplicate ticks, missing data flagged).

* **Backfill historical data** for at least 5–10 years per ticker.

* **Test timestamp alignment:** simulate “time T view” to prevent lookahead bias.

✅ **Output:** Versioned, validated dataset spanning multiple asset classes and regimes.

---

## **Phase 3 – Baseline Modeling & Backtesting (Week 4–6)**

Goal: Train/test simple models & evaluate properly.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **Baseline model:** LightGBM or CatBoost using only prices & ratios.

* **Backtesting framework:**

  * Walk-forward split

  * Transaction costs, slippage simulation

  * Out-of-sample evaluation

* **Build performance dashboard:** metrics over time, confusion matrix, Sharpe curve.

* **Document feature importance:** SHAP integration.

✅ **Output:** First working predictive loop with reliable backtest results.

---

## **Phase 4 – Feature Expansion & Ensembles (Week 6–9)**

Goal: Enrich signals, combine models, increase robustness.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **Add options features:** IV surface, skew, term structure.

* **Add sentiment embeddings:** convert text/news to vector features.

* **Engineer technical \+ multi-horizon features:** z-scores, rolling vol, momentum.

* **Implement ensemble/stacking:** combine trees \+ neural nets \+ linear.

* **Calibrate outputs:** isotonic regression or Platt scaling for probability predictions.

✅ **Output:** Ensemble model outperforming baseline with calibrated probability outputs.

---

## **Phase 5 – Productionization & Drift Handling (Week 9–12)**

Goal: Make the system robust in real-world conditions.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **CI/CD for models:** MLflow registry, GitHub Actions for deployment.

* **Model retraining cadence:** automated nightly retrain; incremental online updates.

* **Data/Concept drift detection:** monitor feature distributions \+ prediction drift.

* **Error alerts & monitoring:** Grafana/Prometheus dashboards.

* **Shadow trading mode:** compare model vs. market without capital at risk.

✅ **Output:** Testable, continuously retraining pipeline with monitoring.

---

## **Phase 6 – Risk, Portfolio & Execution Integration (Week 12–16)**

Goal: Move from predictive model → tradable strategy.

**Tasks / TODOs**

* **Add risk constraints:** max drawdown, VaR, position size limits.

* **Portfolio optimizer:** mean-variance or Black-Litterman with predicted returns.

* **Execution simulator:** order book replay, slippage curves.

* **Deploy to paper trading environment** (Interactive Brokers API, Alpaca).

* **Document performance attribution:** alpha sources, factor exposures.

✅ **Output:** A tradable, testable engine running in simulation mode with real broker API hooks.

# **🔑 Implementation Hierarchy (What matters most for consistency/accuracy)**

1. **Correct labels & leakage prevention** (Phase 1–2)

2. **Rigorous backtesting & validation** (Phase 3\)

3. **Diverse feature set & ensembles** (Phase 4\)

4. **Drift handling & retraining automation** (Phase 5\)

5. **Execution realism & risk controls** (Phase 6\)

👉 This roadmap can be turned directly into **GitHub Issues or Jira epics**, each phase being an epic, each task a ticket.

Would you like me to **expand this into a table-form project plan** (columns: Phase, Tasks, Owner, Dependencies, Test Cases), so you could drop it straight into Jira/Trello/Notion?

##### **You said:**

Yes.

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Got it 👍 — here’s your roadmap reformatted into a **project-plan style table**. Each row is a task you can convert directly into Jira/Trello/Notion issues, with **phase, owner, dependencies, and test cases** clearly outlined.
