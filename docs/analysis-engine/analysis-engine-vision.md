## Leveraging Claude Code for Development

### 1. AI Analysis Engine Development
Use Claude Code to build your core analysis engine.
`claude-code create analysis-engine`
*Tell Claude: "Build a financial analysis engine that processes the EnrichedDataPacket and generates BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations with confidence scores."*

### 2. Data Pipeline Optimization
Optimize your existing API integrations.
`claude-code optimize api-performance`
*Request: "Analyze my 10 financial APIs, implement connection pooling, add circuit breakers, and optimize for parallel execution."*

### 3. Feature Engineering Pipeline
Build sophisticated technical indicators.
`claude-code create technical-indicators`
*Ask: "Create a comprehensive technical analysis module with 50+ indicators, pattern recognition, and momentum signals for stock analysis."*

### 4. Backtesting Framework
Validate your AI predictions.
`claude-code create backtesting-engine`
*Request: "Build a backtesting framework that validates AI recommendations against historical data with performance metrics and risk analysis."*

## AI Analysis Engine Strategy
Your AI should weight these factors dynamically:
- **40%** - Technical & price action signals
- **25%** - Fundamental analysis & financial health
- **20%** - Macroeconomic context & sector rotation
- **10%** - Sentiment & institutional flow
- **5%** - Alternative data & special situations

The key is creating a feedback loop where the AI learns which combinations of signals provide the highest predictive accuracy for different market conditions and stock types.
