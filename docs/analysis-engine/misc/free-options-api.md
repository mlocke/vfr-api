However, there are several services that offer a free tier with options data, which can be useful for hobby projects, learning, or for low-volume applications. Here are some options:

1. Polygon.io
   Polygon.io offers a "Developer" plan that is free forever.

Data: Access to all US options tickers.

Limitations: Data is end-of-day (EOD), and there is a limit of 5 API calls per minute. This is great for analyzing historical data or for applications that don't require real-time updates.

2. Alpha Vantage
   Alpha Vantage is a well-known provider of financial data with a generous free tier.

Data: They offer real-time and historical data for stocks, forex, and options.

Limitations: The free plan has rate limits, and the data may be delayed. It is also typically for personal, non-commercial use.

3. Market Data (MarketData.app)
   This service offers a "Free Forever" plan.

Data: It provides access to delayed options data (24-hour delay), including Greeks, IV, quotes, and more.

Limitations: You get 100 daily API credits and access to 1 year of historical data. This is suitable for those who need to access a small amount of data for a specific project.

4. Alpaca
   Alpaca is a commission-free brokerage and API platform.

Data: Their API provides access to options data, and their 15-minute delayed data is available for free.

Limitations: To get real-time options data, you need to subscribe to a paid plan. The free data is sufficient for non-time-sensitive analysis and paper trading.

Important Considerations:

"Free" is often limited: Keep in mind that "free" usually means you'll be restricted in some way, whether by the number of API calls, the data's freshness (delayed vs. real-time), or the scope of the data (number of tickers, historical depth).

Commercial vs. Personal Use: Most free plans are strictly for personal or non-commercial use. If you plan to build a public application or a product you intend to monetize, you will need to pay for a commercial license.

Data Quality: The quality and reliability of free data can vary. If you are building a critical application, paying for a premium service is often the better and safer choice.
