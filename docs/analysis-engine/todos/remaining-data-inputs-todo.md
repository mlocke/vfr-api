## Composite Scoring Architecture

```typescript
interface EnhancedAnalysisResult {
	technical: number; // 35% weight (reduced from 40%)
	fundamental: number; // 25% weight
	macroeconomic: number; // 20% weight
	sentiment: number; // 10% weight (news sentiment ✅ + Reddit WSB ✅ operational)
	extendedMarket: number; // 5% weight (NEW - liquidity + extended hours ✅ operational)
	alternative: number; // 5% weight (ESG 3% ✅ + Short Interest 2% ✅ operational)
}
```

## Performance Targets

- **Response Time**: <3 seconds
- **Data Freshness**: <15 minutes
- **Uptime**: 99%+ availability
