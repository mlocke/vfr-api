## Composite Scoring Architecture
```typescript
interface EnhancedAnalysisResult {
  technical: number;        // 35% weight (reduced from 40%)
  fundamental: number;      // 25% weight
  macroeconomic: number;    // 20% weight
  sentiment: number;        // 10% weight (news sentiment ✅ + Reddit WSB ✅ operational)
  extendedMarket: number;   // 5% weight (NEW - liquidity + extended hours ✅ operational)
  alternative: number;      // 5% weight (ESG 3% ✅ + Short Interest 2% ✅ operational)
}
```

## Performance Targets
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds
- **Data Freshness**: <15 minutes
- **Uptime**: 99%+ availability
