## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (existing VFR database)
- Redis (existing VFR cache)
- Python 3.9+ (for ML model training)
- GPU access (optional, for faster training)

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install additional ML dependencies
npm install --save lightgbm xgboost @tensorflow/tfjs-node

# Python ML environment
pip install lightgbm xgboost scikit-learn pandas numpy

# Development tools
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

### Initial Development Steps
1. **Review all ML documentation** in `docs/analysis-engine/machine-learning/`
2. **Start with Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Database schema and service foundation
3. **Test each phase thoroughly** before moving to next phase
4. **Monitor performance metrics** continuously during development
5. **Maintain VFR classic analysis** as always-functional fallback
