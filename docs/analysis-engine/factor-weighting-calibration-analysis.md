# VFR Factor Weighting and Scoring Calibration Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Analysis Scope**: Scoring methodology review for AAPL "Sell" vs Market "Moderate Buy" discrepancy
**Key Files Analyzed**:
- `app/services/algorithms/FactorLibrary.ts` (lines 2030-2171)
- `app/services/stock-selection/StockSelectionService.ts` (lines 437-563, 2488-2504)
- `app/services/algorithms/AlgorithmEngine.ts` (lines 1258-1277)

## Executive Summary

VFR's current factor weighting system shows **systematic bias toward valuation metrics and short-term technical momentum**, which can penalize high-quality, established companies like AAPL that trade at premium valuations justified by durable competitive advantages. The analysis reveals three critical issues:

1. **Valuation-heavy fundamental scoring** (35% P/E weight within 22% fundamental allocation)
2. **Technical momentum emphasis** (37% total weight) over-penalizes recent pullbacks
3. **Missing qualitative moat factors** (ecosystem strength, brand value, switching costs)

**Market Divergence**: VFR gives AAPL "SELL" signal while consensus is "Moderate Buy"

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: Valuation Bias in Fundamental Scoring

**Problem**: P/E ratio carries 35% weight within value composite, representing 7.7% of the **total final score**.

**Code Evidence** (`FactorLibrary.ts:1502-1509`):
```typescript
private calculatePEScore(peRatio?: number): number | null {
  if (!peRatio || peRatio <= 0) return null

  // Lower P/E ratios get higher scores
  // Normalize around typical P/E ranges (5-30)
  const normalizedPE = Math.max(0, Math.min(30, peRatio))
  return 1 - (normalizedPE / 30)
}
```

**AAPL Impact Analysis**:
- AAPL P/E: ~29-32 (September 2025)
- VFR Score: `1 - (30/30) = 0.00` (WORST possible score)
- **This single metric contributes -7.7% to final score**

**Why This Is Wrong**:
1. **Growth-Adjusted P/E Missing**: No PEG ratio consideration (AAPL's earnings growth justifies premium)
2. **Sector Context Ignored**: Tech companies naturally trade at higher multiples (sector median ~25-30)
3. **Quality Premium Unaccounted**: High-ROIC businesses deserve valuation premium
4. **Forward P/E Absent**: Uses trailing P/E instead of forward-looking valuation

**Market Perspective** (from `docs/analysis-engine/misc/AAPL Sentiment 09_2025.md`):
- Analysts note "high valuation" but still rate "Moderate Buy"
- Strong ecosystem and services growth justify premium
- Brand loyalty and switching costs not captured in P/E

---

### Issue #2: Technical Momentum Over-Emphasis (37% Weight)

**Problem**: 37% weight on technical factors disproportionately penalizes recent pullbacks, even for fundamentally strong companies.

**Code Evidence** (`FactorLibrary.ts:1918-1924`):
```typescript
const factors = [
  { name: '1-month momentum', value: await this.calculateMomentum(symbol, 21), weight: 0.25 },
  { name: '3-month momentum', value: await this.calculateMomentum(symbol, 63), weight: 0.30 },
  { name: '6-month momentum', value: await this.calculateMomentum(symbol, 126), weight: 0.25 }
]
```

**AAPL Scenario**:
- Document notes: "fading iPhone momentum" after initial strength
- Recent pullback from highs would score poorly on 1-3 month momentum
- **80% of technical momentum weight (25%+30%+25%) captures short-term weakness**

**Why This Is Problematic**:
1. **Mean Reversion Ignored**: Pullbacks in quality stocks often present buying opportunities
2. **Noise vs Signal**: Short-term momentum includes market sentiment noise
3. **Long-Term Trends Underweighted**: 6-month momentum gets same weight as 1-month
4. **Contrarian Opportunity Missed**: Institutional investors often buy pullbacks in quality names

---

### Issue #3: Missing Qualitative Moat Factors

**Problem**: No scoring for durable competitive advantages that Wall Street analysts emphasize.

**Unmodeled Factors for AAPL**:
1. **Ecosystem Lock-In** (from doc: "robust ecosystem and interconnectedness")
   - 2 billion active devices
   - Switching costs create customer lifetime value
   - Services revenue growing at 15%+ (high margin)

2. **Brand Value**
   - Premium pricing power
   - Customer loyalty metrics
   - Brand equity not in financial ratios

3. **Services Growth Trajectory**
   - Services margin: 70%+ vs 40% products
   - Recurring revenue reduces cyclicality
   - Not captured in traditional P/E

4. **Manufacturing Diversification** (doc: "India and Vietnam expansion")
   - Supply chain resilience
   - Geopolitical risk mitigation
   - Future margin improvement potential

5. **AI Strategy Long-Term Optionality**
   - Document notes: "AI strategy will eventually provide significant boost"
   - Multi-year investment cycle not in TTM earnings

**Current System**: These factors **completely absent** from scoring methodology.

---

### Issue #4: Scoring Cascade Amplifies Initial Bias

**Problem**: Sequential adjustments compound initial scoring errors.

**Code Flow** (`StockSelectionService.ts:442-555`):
```typescript
// Base score calculated with issues above
let adjustedScore = stockScore

// Macro adjustment (can shift ¬±10-20%)
adjustedScore.overallScore = macroImpact.adjustedScore

// Sentiment adjustment (can shift ¬±5-10%)
adjustedScore.overallScore = sentimentImpact.adjustedScore

// ESG adjustment (¬±2-5%)
adjustedScore.overallScore = esgImpact.adjustedScore

// Short interest adjustment (¬±2-5%)
adjustedScore.overallScore = shortInterestImpact.adjustedScore

// ML prediction adjustment (can shift significantly)
adjustedScore.overallScore = mlScore
```

**Amplification Effect**:
- If base score is 0.45 due to valuation bias
- Each negative adjustment (macro headwinds, negative sentiment) compounds
- Final score: `0.45 √ó 0.95 √ó 0.90 √ó 0.95 = 0.365` ‚Üí **SELL signal**
- **No corrective mechanism** for qualitative strength

---

### Issue #5: Threshold Calibration May Be Too Aggressive

**Current Thresholds** (`StockSelectionService.ts:2488-2504`):
```typescript
private determineActionFromScore(score: number): 'BUY' | 'SELL' | 'HOLD' {
  const normalizedScore = score > 1 ? score / 100 : score

  if (normalizedScore >= 0.70) return 'BUY'      // Top 30%
  else if (normalizedScore <= 0.30) return 'SELL' // Bottom 30%
  else return 'HOLD'                              // Middle 40%
}
```

**Analysis**:
- 70% threshold for BUY is **very high** (A- grade equivalent)
- 30% threshold for SELL is **low** (F grade at 29%, D at 31%)
- **40% dead zone** for HOLD creates volatility in recommendations
- No confidence intervals or margin of error consideration

**Market Reality**:
- Analyst ratings typically: Buy (60%+), Hold (40-60%), Sell (<40%)
- VFR's 70% threshold more stringent than institutional standards

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Design Philosophy Issues

1. **Value-Centric Bias**
   - System designed to find "cheap" stocks
   - Penalizes "quality at reasonable price" strategy
   - No distinction between expensive-bad and expensive-justified

2. **Quantitative-Only Approach**
   - All factors must have numerical inputs
   - Qualitative moat factors excluded by design
   - Missing "soft" factors that analysts emphasize

3. **Static Weighting**
   - Same weights for all company types
   - Growth stocks scored like value stocks
   - No sector-relative adjustments

4. **Short-Term Focus**
   - 37% technical + 9% sentiment = 46% on near-term signals
   - Long-term competitive position underweighted
   - Investment horizon mismatch with "buy and hold" users

---

## Recommendations

### Recommendation #1: Implement Dynamic Weighting Based on Company Profile

**Concept**: Adjust factor weights based on company characteristics.

**Implementation** (`FactorLibrary.ts` - new method):
```typescript
private determineWeightingProfile(
  marketCap: number,
  sector: string,
  growthRate: number,
  profitMargin: number
): {
  technical: number,
  fundamental: number,
  macro: number,
  sentiment: number
} {
  // Mega-cap quality companies (like AAPL)
  if (marketCap > 1_000_000_000_000) { // $1T+
    return {
      technical: 0.25,      // Reduced - less momentum-driven
      fundamental: 0.35,    // Increased - quality matters more
      macro: 0.25,          // Increased - macro impacts large caps
      sentiment: 0.15       // Sentiment matters for big tech
    }
  }

  // Small/Mid-cap growth
  if (marketCap < 50_000_000_000 && growthRate > 0.15) {
    return {
      technical: 0.45,      // Momentum important for small caps
      fundamental: 0.25,    // Less established metrics
      macro: 0.15,          // Less macro-sensitive
      sentiment: 0.15
    }
  }

  // Value plays
  if (profitMargin < 0.10 && peRatio < 15) {
    return {
      technical: 0.30,
      fundamental: 0.40,    // Valuation most important
      macro: 0.20,
      sentiment: 0.10
    }
  }

  // Default (current weights)
  return {
    technical: 0.37,
    fundamental: 0.22,
    macro: 0.18,
    sentiment: 0.09
  }
}
```

**Impact on AAPL**:
- Technical weight: 37% ‚Üí 25% (-12%)
- Fundamental weight: 22% ‚Üí 35% (+13%)
- Reduces momentum over-emphasis
- Increases quality factor importance

---

### Recommendation #2: Add Growth-Adjusted Valuation Metrics

**Problem**: P/E score ignores growth and quality context.

**Solution**: Implement PEG ratio and quality-adjusted P/E scoring.

**Implementation** (`FactorLibrary.ts`):
```typescript
private calculateGrowthAdjustedPEScore(
  peRatio: number,
  earningsGrowth: number,
  roe: number,
  sector: string
): number {
  // PEG Ratio: P/E divided by growth rate
  const pegRatio = peRatio / (earningsGrowth * 100)

  // Quality adjustment: High ROE deserves premium
  let qualityMultiplier = 1.0
  if (roe > 0.20) qualityMultiplier = 0.85      // 15% premium allowed
  else if (roe > 0.15) qualityMultiplier = 0.90 // 10% premium allowed

  // Sector-relative P/E
  const sectorMedianPE = this.getSectorMedianPE(sector)
  const relativeValuation = peRatio / sectorMedianPE

  // Combined score
  let score = 0.5 // Neutral baseline

  // PEG scoring (most important for growth companies)
  if (pegRatio < 1.0) score += 0.3      // Undervalued vs growth
  else if (pegRatio < 1.5) score += 0.2 // Fair value
  else if (pegRatio < 2.0) score += 0.1 // Slightly expensive
  else score -= 0.1                      // Expensive vs growth

  // Sector-relative scoring
  if (relativeValuation < 0.8) score += 0.1    // Cheap vs sector
  else if (relativeValuation < 1.2) score += 0  // In line with sector
  else score -= 0.1 * (relativeValuation - 1.2) // Premium to sector

  // Quality adjustment
  if (roe > 0.20) score += 0.1 // High quality deserves premium

  return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, score))
}
```

**AAPL Example**:
```
Current System:
  P/E = 30 ‚Üí Score = 0.00 (terrible)

Proposed System:
  P/E = 30, Growth = 10%, ROE = 30%, Sector = Tech
  PEG = 30/10 = 3.0
  Sector median P/E = 25
  Relative valuation = 30/25 = 1.2

  Score = 0.5 (base)
        - 0.1 (PEG > 2.0)
        + 0.0 (relative valuation 1.2 = in line)
        + 0.1 (ROE > 20%)
        = 0.50 (neutral instead of terrible)
```

**Impact**: Eliminates -7.7% penalty for justified premium valuation.

---

### Recommendation #3: Integrate Qualitative Moat Scoring

**Concept**: Add "Competitive Moat" factor (5-10% weight) to capture durable advantages.

**Data Sources**:
1. **Services Revenue Growth** (quantifiable proxy for ecosystem strength)
2. **Brand Value Rankings** (Interbrand, Brand Finance APIs)
3. **Customer Retention Rates** (from earnings calls, can be scraped)
4. **Pricing Power** (gross margin trends vs industry)
5. **Market Share Trends** (IDC, Gartner data)

**Implementation** (`FactorLibrary.ts` - new composite):
```typescript
async calculateCompetitiveMoatScore(
  symbol: string,
  sector: string,
  fundamentalData: FundamentalDataPoint
): Promise<number> {
  let moatScore = 0.5 // Neutral baseline

  // 1. Gross margin trend (pricing power proxy)
  if (fundamentalData.grossProfitMargin > 0.40) moatScore += 0.15
  else if (fundamentalData.grossProfitMargin > 0.30) moatScore += 0.10

  // 2. Market share stability (from market data services)
  const marketShareTrend = await this.getMarketShareTrend(symbol, sector)
  if (marketShareTrend === 'growing') moatScore += 0.15
  else if (marketShareTrend === 'stable') moatScore += 0.10
  else moatScore -= 0.10

  // 3. Services/recurring revenue (if available)
  const recurringRevenuePct = await this.getRecurringRevenuePct(symbol)
  if (recurringRevenuePct > 0.30) moatScore += 0.10
  else if (recurringRevenuePct > 0.15) moatScore += 0.05

  // 4. Brand value (from Interbrand API or similar)
  const brandRanking = await this.getBrandRanking(symbol)
  if (brandRanking <= 10) moatScore += 0.15      // Top 10 global brand
  else if (brandRanking <= 50) moatScore += 0.10
  else if (brandRanking <= 100) moatScore += 0.05

  return Math.max(0, Math.min(1, moatScore))
}
```

**Revised Weight Allocation**:
```
Technical Analysis:        32.0% (reduced from 37%)
Fundamental Analysis:      22.0% (unchanged)
Competitive Moat:           8.0% (NEW)
Macroeconomic Context:     18.0% (unchanged)
Sentiment Analysis:         9.0% (unchanged)
Options Analysis:           5.0% (unchanged)
Extended Market Data:       4.5% (unchanged)
Short Interest:             2.25% (unchanged)
ESG Factors:                2.25% (unchanged, but could reduce to 1% to fund moat)
```

**AAPL Benefit**:
- Gross margin: 45%+ ‚Üí +0.15
- Market share: Stable in smartphones, growing in services ‚Üí +0.10
- Services revenue: 25%+ of total ‚Üí +0.10
- Brand ranking: Top 3 globally ‚Üí +0.15
- **Total moat score: 0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00 (perfect score)**
- **Adds +8% to final score**

---

### Recommendation #4: Adjust BUY/SELL/HOLD Thresholds with Confidence Bands

**Problem**: 70/30 thresholds too aggressive, no uncertainty modeling.

**Solution**: Use confidence-adjusted thresholds.

**Implementation** (`StockSelectionService.ts`):
```typescript
private determineActionFromScore(
  score: number,
  dataQuality: number,
  volatility: number
): 'BUY' | 'SELL' | 'HOLD' {
  const normalizedScore = score > 1 ? score / 100 : score

  // Base thresholds (more aligned with market standards)
  let buyThreshold = 0.60  // Changed from 0.70
  let sellThreshold = 0.40  // Changed from 0.30

  // Widen bands for low data quality
  if (dataQuality < 0.7) {
    buyThreshold += 0.05
    sellThreshold -= 0.05
  }

  // Widen bands for high volatility (uncertainty premium)
  if (volatility > 0.30) { // 30%+ annualized vol
    buyThreshold += 0.05
    sellThreshold -= 0.05
  }

  // Confidence-based recommendations
  if (normalizedScore >= buyThreshold) {
    return 'BUY'
  } else if (normalizedScore <= sellThreshold) {
    return 'SELL'
  } else {
    // HOLD range: 40-60% (more reasonable than 30-70%)
    return 'HOLD'
  }
}
```

**Rationale**:
- 60% BUY threshold matches institutional "Buy" rating (60-65% typical)
- 40% SELL threshold prevents false negatives on quality stocks
- 20% HOLD range (vs 40%) reduces "paralysis by analysis"
- Confidence adjustments prevent overconfidence with incomplete data

**Impact on AAPL**:
- If score improves to 0.55 with moat scoring and dynamic weighting
- Current system: HOLD (below 0.70)
- Proposed system: BUY (above 0.60 with high data quality)

---

### Recommendation #5: Implement Scenario-Based Scoring

**Concept**: Score stocks under multiple future scenarios, weight by probability.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
async calculateScenarioWeightedScore(
  symbol: string,
  baseScore: number
): Promise<{
  weightedScore: number,
  scenarios: Array<{name: string, score: number, probability: number}>
}> {
  const scenarios = [
    // Bull case: Growth accelerates, margins expand
    {
      name: 'bull',
      adjustments: {
        technicalWeight: -0.10,    // Less important
        fundamentalWeight: +0.10,  // Quality rewarded
        macroBoost: +0.10          // Favorable environment
      },
      probability: 0.25
    },

    // Base case: Steady growth, stable margins
    {
      name: 'base',
      adjustments: {}, // No changes
      probability: 0.50
    },

    // Bear case: Competition intensifies, margins compress
    {
      name: 'bear',
      adjustments: {
        technicalWeight: +0.10,    // Momentum matters more
        fundamentalWeight: -0.05,  // Quality less protective
        macroDrag: -0.10           // Headwinds
      },
      probability: 0.25
    }
  ]

  let weightedScore = 0
  const scenarioResults = []

  for (const scenario of scenarios) {
    let scenarioScore = baseScore

    // Apply scenario adjustments
    if (scenario.adjustments.macroBoost) {
      scenarioScore += scenario.adjustments.macroBoost
    }
    if (scenario.adjustments.macroDrag) {
      scenarioScore += scenario.adjustments.macroDrag
    }

    scenarioResults.push({
      name: scenario.name,
      score: scenarioScore,
      probability: scenario.probability
    })

    weightedScore += scenarioScore * scenario.probability
  }

  return {
    weightedScore,
    scenarios: scenarioResults
  }
}
```

**UI Presentation**:
```
AAPL Analysis:

Probability-Weighted Score: 0.65 ‚Üí BUY

Scenario Breakdown:
  Bull Case (25%): 0.75 - Strong Buy
  Base Case (50%): 0.65 - Buy
  Bear Case (25%): 0.45 - Hold

Risk-Reward: Asymmetric upside (2:1 ratio)
```

---

## Validation and Testing

### Backtest Requirements

**Test Universe**: 500 large-cap stocks (S&P 500)
**Time Period**: 2020-2025 (5 years)
**Frequency**: Monthly rebalancing

**Metrics to Track**:
1. **Alignment with Analyst Ratings**
   - Correlation between VFR score and consensus rating
   - Current: Likely 0.4-0.5 (weak)
   - Target: 0.70-0.75 (strong)

2. **False Negative Rate**
   - Stocks rated SELL that outperformed market over next 12 months
   - Current: Likely 30-40% (high)
   - Target: <15% (acceptable)

3. **Portfolio Performance**
   - Sharpe ratio of top quintile (BUY-rated stocks)
   - Current: Unknown
   - Target: >1.0 (vs S&P 500)

4. **Sector Neutrality**
   - Distribution of BUY ratings across sectors
   - Current: Likely biased toward value/financial sectors
   - Target: Representative of market cap weighting

### A/B Testing Plan

**Phase 1 Quick Wins**: Run parallel scoring
- Old system (current weights)
- New system (adjusted thresholds + PEG scoring)
- Compare for 2-week period across 50 symbols

**Success Criteria**:
- AAPL-like quality names move from SELL to HOLD/BUY
- No significant degradation on value stock identification
- User feedback positive on recommendation quality

---

## Risk Assessment

### Risks of Implementing Changes

1. **Over-Fitting to AAPL Case**
   - **Mitigation**: Test across diverse stock universe
   - **Monitoring**: Track performance across market caps and sectors

2. **Growth Trap**
   - Concern: Reduced valuation emphasis may over-rate expensive growth stocks
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain sector-relative checks, PEG ratio caps
   - **Threshold**: Flag stocks with PEG > 3.0 as "speculative"

3. **Data Availability for Moat Scoring**
   - Challenge: Brand value APIs may have coverage gaps
   - **Mitigation**: Start with quantifiable proxies, phase in premium data
   - **Fallback**: Use neutral score (0.5) when data unavailable

4. **Computational Performance**
   - Concern: Dynamic weighting adds complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Cache profiling results, optimize queries
   - **Target**: Maintain <3s analysis completion time

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

### How Other Platforms Handle This

**Morningstar**:
- **Moat Rating**: Wide/Narrow/None (qualitative assessment)
- **Fair Value Estimate**: Growth-adjusted intrinsic value
- **Star Rating**: Relative to fair value, not absolute metrics
- **Lesson**: Explicit moat scoring, relative valuation vs intrinsic value

**Zacks**:
- **Industry Rank**: Sector-relative scoring
- **Growth Score**: Separate from value score
- **Composite Rating**: Industry + Momentum + Earnings + Value
- **Lesson**: Multi-dimensional scoring with sector context

**TipRanks**:
- **Smart Score**: 1-10 scale combining 8 factors
- **Analyst Consensus**: Weighted by accuracy track record
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjusted by sector and market cap
- **Lesson**: Proven dynamic threshold approach works

**Key Takeaway**: All major platforms use sector-relative and growth-adjusted metrics. VFR's absolute scoring is out of step with industry best practices.

## Conclusion

VFR's current factor weighting system is **systematically biased against high-quality, premium-valuation companies** due to:
1. Over-emphasis on absolute valuation metrics (P/E) without growth adjustment
2. Technical momentum over-weighting (37%) that penalizes short-term pullbacks
3. Complete absence of competitive moat/qualitative strength factors
4. Overly aggressive BUY threshold (70%) vs industry standard (60%)

**Immediate Action Items** (2-week sprint):
1. Adjust BUY/SELL thresholds: 70/30 ‚Üí 60/40
2. Implement PEG ratio scoring to replace pure P/E
3. Reduce technical weight for mega-caps: 37% ‚Üí 30%

**Expected Impact**: AAPL and similar quality names move from SELL to HOLD/BUY, aligning with market consensus while maintaining value stock identification capability.

**Long-Term Vision**: Dynamic, context-aware scoring system that adapts to company profile, sector characteristics, and qualitative strengths‚Äîmatching institutional research quality.

## Appendix A: Mathematical Proof of Valuation Bias Impact

### Current System AAPL Scoring Breakdown

**Assumptions** (September 2025 market data):
- Market Cap: $3.0T
- P/E Ratio: 30
- EPS Growth: 10%
- ROE: 30%
- Debt/Equity: 0.15
- Gross Margin: 45%
- Recent pullback: -10% from 3-month high

**Score Calculation**:

1. **Fundamental Analysis (22% weight)**:
   ```
   Quality Composite (assumed 50% of fundamental):
     ROE (30%): 30% ROE ‚Üí score 0.80 √ó 0.30 = 0.24
     Debt/Equity (25%): 0.15 ‚Üí score 0.97 √ó 0.25 = 0.24
     Current Ratio (20%): 2.5 ‚Üí score 0.90 √ó 0.20 = 0.18
     Operating Margin (15%): 30% ‚Üí score 0.85 √ó 0.15 = 0.13
     Gross Margin (10%): 45% ‚Üí score 0.95 √ó 0.10 = 0.10
     Quality Score: 0.89 (excellent)

   Value Composite (assumed 50% of fundamental):
     P/E (35%): 30 ‚Üí score 0.00 √ó 0.35 = 0.00 ‚ö†Ô∏è
     P/B (25%): 8.0 ‚Üí score 0.20 √ó 0.25 = 0.05
     P/S (25%): 7.5 ‚Üí score 0.25 √ó 0.25 = 0.06
     EV/EBITDA (15%): 22 ‚Üí score 0.12 √ó 0.15 = 0.02
     Value Score: 0.13 (terrible)

   Combined Fundamental: (0.89 + 0.13) / 2 = 0.51
   Contribution to total: 0.51 √ó 0.22 = 0.11
   ```

2. **Technical Analysis (37% weight)**:
   ```
   Momentum (85% of technical):
     1-month: -10% ‚Üí score 0.20
     3-month: +5% ‚Üí score 0.55
     6-month: +15% ‚Üí score 0.70
     RSI: 45 ‚Üí score 0.45
     MACD: Bearish ‚Üí score 0.30
     Technical Score: 0.44 (weak)

   Contribution to total: 0.44 √ó 0.37 = 0.16
   ```

3. **Other Factors** (assumed neutral at 0.50 each):
   ```
   Macro (18%): 0.50 √ó 0.18 = 0.09
   Sentiment (9%): 0.50 √ó 0.09 = 0.045
   Options (5%): 0.50 √ó 0.05 = 0.025
   Other (9.5%): 0.50 √ó 0.095 = 0.048
   ```

**Total Score**: 0.11 + 0.16 + 0.09 + 0.045 + 0.025 + 0.048 = **0.478**

**Action**: HOLD (between 0.30-0.70)

**But**: After cascade adjustments (macro headwinds, negative sentiment), likely falls to 0.35-0.40 ‚Üí **SELL**
