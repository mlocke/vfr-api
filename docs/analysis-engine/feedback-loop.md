## **How to Feed the System**



### **Data Collection Pipeline:\#\# Implementation Strategy**



### **Phase 1: Basic Feedback Loop (Week 1-2)**



1. **Start simple** \- Track directional accuracy only

2. **Collect 50+ features** from your existing APIs

3. **Record every prediction** with timestamp and confidence

4. **Evaluate outcomes** after each time horizon

5. **Calculate basic feature importance** using correlation analysis



### **Phase 2: Advanced Learning (Week 3-4)**



1. **Add contextual learning** \- Different weights for bull/bear markets

2. **Implement Shapley values** for feature importance

3. **Add performance metrics** \- Sharpe ratio, max drawdown

4. **Create ensemble model** \- Combine multiple prediction approaches



### **Phase 3: Sophisticated AI (Week 5-8)**



1. **Online learning** \- Continuous model updates

2. **Regime detection** \- Automatically detect market regime changes

3. **Feature interactions** \- Learn which features work together

4. **Meta-learning** \- Learn how to learn faster

## **Key Success Metrics to Track**



**Model Performance:**



* **Directional accuracy** by time horizon

* **Risk-adjusted returns** (Sharpe ratio)

* **Calibration** (confidence vs actual accuracy)

* **Feature stability** over time



**Learning Effectiveness:**



* **Improvement rate** of predictions over time

* **Adaptation speed** to market regime changes

* **Feature importance evolution**

* **Context-specific performance**



The feedback loop is essentially creating a **self-improving AI** that gets smarter with every prediction. The key is starting simple and gradually adding sophistication as you collect more data and outcomes.
